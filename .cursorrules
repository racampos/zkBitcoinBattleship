# Cursor Rules for BitcoinShip Project

## CRITICAL: Testing Before Commits

**NEVER COMMIT CODE WITHOUT USER TESTING FIRST**

Rules:

1. After making code changes, ALWAYS wait for the user to test them
2. NEVER run `git commit` until the user explicitly confirms the changes work
3. If the user reports an error, fix it and wait for testing again
4. Only commit when the user says "this works" or "commit this" or similar
5. If unsure whether to commit, ASK the user first

Exceptions:

- Documentation-only changes (README, markdown files with no code impact)
- The user explicitly says "commit this" or "go ahead and commit"

## Git Workflow

1. Make changes
2. Show/explain changes to user
3. **WAIT FOR USER TO TEST**
4. User confirms it works or reports issues
5. If issues, go back to step 1
6. If confirmed working, THEN commit with user permission

## Commit Protocol

Before running `git commit`:

- ✅ User has tested the changes
- ✅ User confirmed it works OR gave explicit permission to commit
- ❌ NEVER commit "fixes" that haven't been verified

This is a HARD RULE. No exceptions except documentation.
