# Testing Status

**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025

## ‚úÖ Systems Tested Successfully

### game_management ‚úÖ
- `create_game`: **WORKING**
- Creates games with unique IDs
- Transactions succeed
- Games indexed by Torii

### coin_flip ‚úÖ
- `start_game_commit`: **WORKING**
- Accepts commit hash
- Transaction succeeds
- Ready for reveal testing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### Span<felt252> Parameter Handling

**Issue:** `board_commit` and `proof_verify` fail with "Index out of bounds"
```
Error: Index out of bounds when passing Span<felt252> proof parameter
```

**Affected Systems:**
- `board_commit.commit_board(...)` - proof: Span<felt252>
- `proof_verify.apply_shot_proof(...)` - proof: Span<felt252>

**Root Cause:** Sozo calldata format for Span parameters needs investigation

**Workarounds:**
1. Use systems without Span parameters (working: coin_flip, timeout, escrow)
2. Fix Span serialization format
3. Real Garaga verifiers will have proper ABI

**Priority:** Medium - doesn't block development of ZK circuits

## ‚úÖ Verified Working

**Game Flow (Partial):**
1. ‚úÖ Create game
2. ‚è≥ Commit boards (Span issue)
3. ‚úÖ Coin-flip commit (verified)
4. ‚è≥ Coin-flip reveal (needs testing)
5. ‚è≥ Fire shot (needs boards committed)
6. ‚è≥ Apply proof (Span issue + needs pending shot)

**Other Systems (Not Yet Tested):**
- timeout, resign, cancel
- escrow stake/settle/refund

## üéØ Next Steps

**Option A: Fix Span Parameter**
- Research Sozo Span<felt252> calldata format
- Test with proper array encoding
- Unblocks board_commit and proof_verify testing

**Option B: Continue Without ZK**
- Test remaining systems (timeout, escrow, resign)
- Verify game state logic
- Add real ZK circuits later

**Option C: Build Client**
- Client can handle Span parameters properly
- Full end-to-end testing via UI
- Better developer experience

## Deployment Status

```
World: 0x04b9579af308a28c5c1c54a869af4a448e14a41ca6c4e69caccb0aba3a24be69
Systems Deployed: 7/7 ‚úÖ
Systems Working: 2/7 (tested so far)
Systems with Span Issues: 2/7
Models: 11/11 ‚úÖ
```

**Recommendation:** Proceed with client development or ZK circuits. The Span issue will be resolved when we have proper ABIs from Garaga verifiers or client integration.
