Short answer: it’s (almost certainly) not GraphQL or timing. Your React app is writing to a **different World/contract address** than the Torii instance you’re querying. The vanilla JS page resolves the address from the Dojo manifest (`getContractAddress(...)`), which matches the World Torii is indexing; your React app uses a hard-coded/config value (`config.contracts.boardCommit`) that (very likely) points to an older deploy or a different World. If Torii isn’t indexing that World, `entities(...)` will be empty forever—no matter how many times you poll or how identical the query looks.

Below is a tight triage + fixes list you can apply right now.

---

## Fast Triage (2–3 mins)

1. **Log the exact contract address you execute against** in React:

```ts
console.log("commit to address:", config.contracts.boardCommit);
```

2. **Ask Torii what World it’s indexing** (from your Torii startup logs or env):

- `TORII_WORLD_ADDRESS` (env) or startup log line like `World: 0x...`.
- If you use Torii’s multi-world mode, ensure you pass the same world (header or query param) consistently from both apps.

3. **Compare** that World’s **BoardCommit** address against the one React is using:

- In vanilla: `getContractAddress("battleship-board_commit")` → **copy this value**.
- In React: `config.contracts.boardCommit` → **these two must be identical**.

If they differ: that’s the bug.

---

## Why your symptoms match a World/manifest mismatch

- **Vanilla works** because it pulls addresses from the same manifest Torii ingested (Dojo’s current deploy).
- **React always returns `edges: []`** (and even model-level queries are empty) because Torii isn’t indexing the World your React app wrote to.
- **Polling/timing changes nothing**—there’s simply no entity in Torii’s DB for those keys in that World.

---

## Hardening (make it impossible to drift again)

### 1) Stop hard-coding addresses in React

Create a single source of truth that both UIs import—**the same manifest** Torii was started with.

```ts
// packages/common/dojoConfig.ts
import manifest from "../../manifests/katana/manifest.json"; // <-- same file Torii uses

export const WORLD_ADDRESS = manifest.world.address;
export const CONTRACTS = {
  boardCommit: manifest.contracts.find(
    (c) => c.tag === "battleship-board_commit"
  )!.address,
};
```

Use this everywhere:

```ts
// useGameContracts.ts
const tx = await account.execute({
  contractAddress: CONTRACTS.boardCommit,
  entrypoint: "commit_board",
  calldata: [gameId, boardHash],
});
```

### 2) (If you use multi-world Torii) include the world on GraphQL requests

Some setups let you pin the world in a header or query param. Whichever you configured Torii with, **send the same value from both apps** so you can’t accidentally read a different world.

```ts
// Example: append a world param if supported by your Torii version
const TORII_URL = `http://localhost:8081/graphql?world=${WORLD_ADDRESS}`;
```

### 3) Normalize keys and use variables (guards against invisible chars)

Even if not the root cause, this removes another class of “looks identical but isn’t” bugs.

```ts
const norm = (v: string) =>
  "0x" + v.toLowerCase().replace(/^0x/, "").padStart(64, "0");

const q = `
  query ($keys: [String!]!) {
    entities(keys: $keys) {
      edges {
        node {
          models {
            __typename
            ... on battleship_BoardCommit {
              commitment
              player
              game_id
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

const variables = { keys: [norm(gameId), norm(account.address)] };

const res = await fetch(TORII_URL, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: q, variables }),
});
```

### 4) Quick control queries (prove the indexer/world alignment)

Run these in your React console **and** in the vanilla page (they should both work and return the same data):

- “Do I see any BoardCommit models at all?”

```graphql
{
  battleship_BoardCommitModels(first: 3, order: { updatedAt: DESC }) {
    edges {
      node {
        game_id
        player
        commitment
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If this is empty in React but not in Vanilla—or empty in both after your React commit—you’re on the wrong world or wrong Torii.

- “Show me _this_ player’s commits regardless of keys array order”

```graphql
query ($player: String!) {
  battleship_BoardCommitModels(
    first: 3
    where: { player: { equals: $player } }
    order: { updatedAt: DESC }
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        game_id
        player
        commitment
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5) Log the world + contract every time you commit and every time you query

Right before `execute(...)` and right before `fetch(...)`:

```ts
console.log("WORLD", WORLD_ADDRESS);
console.log("BoardCommit address", CONTRACTS.boardCommit);
console.log("Keys", [norm(gameId), norm(account.address)]);
```

If any of these differ from the vanilla app, you’ve found it.

---

## Answers to your specific questions

1. **Why empty only in React?**
   Because React is committing to (or querying) a different **World/contract address** than Torii indexes. Same query + same keys won’t help if the entity lives in a different world.

2. **`account` object differences?**
   Not the root cause here. Still, log `account.address` at commit time **and** at query time to verify they match.

3. **Polling interference?**
   No. Polling more doesn’t hide existing rows; it just repeats the empty result.

4. **Waiting for receipt vs timeout?**
   Also not the root cause. Torii lag can be ~1–3s, but you’re already polling. World mismatch explains a permanent empty result.

5. **Invisible characters / case sensitivity?**
   Rare, but normalize anyway (lowercase, 0x-prefixed, 64-hex padded) and use GraphQL variables to eliminate string-interpolation glitches.

---

## TL;DR Fix

- Make React import the **same manifest** the vanilla app uses (the one Torii ingested).
- Use that manifest to derive `WORLD_ADDRESS` and `boardCommit` address.
- (If using multi-world Torii) pass the world consistently on GraphQL requests.
- Normalize keys + use variables.

Do those and your React hook will start returning the same `battleship_BoardCommit` result your vanilla page sees.

Looking at this carefully, I can see several potential issues. Let me analyze the key differences:

## Most Likely Issue: Account Instance Mismatch

The critical difference is **where the `account` object comes from**:

**Vanilla JS:**

```javascript
// Uses the SAME global `account` variable for both:
await account.execute({...});  // Send transaction
// AND
entities(keys: ["${currentGameId}", "${account.address}"])  // Query
```

**React:**

```typescript
// commitBoard uses `account` from useGameContracts
await account.execute({...});

// BUT useBoardCommitStatus uses account from useGameStore
const { gameId, account } = useGameStore();
entities(keys: ["${gameId}", "${account.address}"])
```

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Verify the account objects match:**

```typescript
// In useGameContracts.ts, after sending transaction:
console.log("🔍 TX Account:", account.address);

// In useBoardCommitStatus.ts:
console.log("🔍 Query Account:", account?.address);

// Compare these EXACT strings (including case, padding, format)
```

2. **Log the account object structure:**

```typescript
// In both places:
console.log("🔍 Full account object:", {
  address: account.address,
  type: typeof account.address,
  length: account.address?.length,
});
```

## Secondary Issue: Effect Dependencies

Your `useBoardCommitStatus` hook has a subtle bug:

```typescript
}, [gameId, account, isCommitted]);
```

Including `isCommitted` as a dependency causes the effect to re-run every time `isCommitted` changes, which recreates the intervals. Try this fix:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!gameId || !account) {
    setIsCommitted(false);
    return;
  }

  let isMounted = true;

  const checkCommitStatus = async () => {
    if (!isMounted) return;

    setIsChecking(true);
    try {
      console.log("🔍 Checking with account:", account.address);

      const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8081/graphql", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          query: `{
            entities(keys: ["${gameId}", "${account.address}"]) {
              edges {
                node {
                  models {
                    __typename
                    ... on battleship_BoardCommit {
                      commitment
                      player
                      game_id
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }`,
        }),
      });

      const result = await response.json();
      console.log("🔍 Full result:", JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

      const boardCommit = result.data?.entities?.edges[0]?.node?.models?.find(
        (m: any) => m.__typename === "battleship_BoardCommit"
      );

      if (boardCommit?.commitment && isMounted) {
        console.log("✅ Found commit:", boardCommit);
        setIsCommitted(true);
      } else {
        console.log("❌ No commit found");
        if (isMounted) setIsCommitted(false);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error:", error);
      if (isMounted) setIsCommitted(false);
    } finally {
      if (isMounted) setIsChecking(false);
    }
  };

  checkCommitStatus();
  const interval = setInterval(checkCommitStatus, 3000);

  return () => {
    isMounted = false;
    clearInterval(interval);
  };
}, [gameId, account]); // Remove isCommitted from dependencies
```

## Third Possibility: Address Padding

Even though you tried this, let's be explicit. Starknet addresses should be consistently padded:

```typescript
// Helper function
const normalizeAddress = (addr: string): string => {
  if (!addr) return addr;
  // Remove 0x, pad to 64 chars, add 0x back
  const hex = addr.replace('0x', '');
  return '0x' + hex.padStart(64, '0');
};

// Use in query:
const normalizedAddress = normalizeAddress(account.address);
entities(keys: ["${gameId}", "${normalizedAddress}"])
```

## Recommended Debugging Approach

Add this temporary diagnostic component:

```typescript
// DebugCommit.tsx
export function DebugCommit() {
  const { gameId, account } = useGameStore();
  const [lastTxAccount, setLastTxAccount] = useState<string>("");

  // Expose this globally for testing
  useEffect(() => {
    (window as any).debugAccounts = {
      storeAccount: account?.address,
      lastTxAccount,
      match: account?.address === lastTxAccount,
    };
  }, [account, lastTxAccount]);

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        position: "fixed",
        bottom: 0,
        left: 0,
        background: "#000",
        color: "#0f0",
        padding: "10px",
        fontSize: "10px",
      }}
    >
      <div>Store Account: {account?.address}</div>
      <div>Last TX Account: {lastTxAccount}</div>
      <div>Match: {account?.address === lastTxAccount ? "✅" : "❌"}</div>
      <button
        onClick={async () => {
          // Get account from contracts hook
          const contractsAccount = useGameContracts.getState().account;
          setLastTxAccount(contractsAccount?.address || "none");
        }}
      >
        Check Contract Account
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

My strongest hypothesis is that **the account in your Zustand store is not the same instance as the account being used to send transactions**, causing an address mismatch. The vanilla JS version works because it uses the exact same global `account` variable for both operations.

# Gemini

This is a fascinating and well-documented issue. The detailed breakdown makes it much easier to analyze. Based on the information provided, here is an analysis of the potential causes and a series of recommended steps to debug the problem.

### Executive Summary

The evidence strongly suggests the problem is not a simple race condition or a difference in the GraphQL query structure. The fact that polling in the React version _never_ succeeds points to a persistent, underlying issue.

The most likely cause is a **subtle discrepancy in the entity keys** (`gameId` or `account.address`) being used in the React query versus the keys stored by Torii. This could be due to a data formatting difference (e.g., hex string padding) or a state management bug where the `account` object queried is not the same one that sent the transaction.

---

### Analysis of Potential Causes

Let's address the questions you raised, integrating the observations.

#### 1. Why does Torii return empty results for React but not vanilla JS?

This almost certainly means that from Torii's perspective, the `keys` being provided in the React app's query do not match any entity in its database. While the queries and logged keys _appear_ identical, a subtle, non-visible difference is likely the culprit.

#### 2. Could there be a difference in how the `account` object is constructed?

**This is a very strong possibility.** While both implementations use Cartridge, the context is different (a global variable vs. a Zustand store in a reactive environment). There could be a difference in:

- **Address Formatting:** One environment might be using a zero-padded hex address while the other is not. For example, `0x...` with 66 characters vs. a shorter, non-padded version. The key stored by Torii is based on the canonical value from the chain, and the query must match it exactly.
- **Stale State/Race Condition:** While you use the same store, it's possible the `account` object referenced by the `commitBoard` function is different from the one referenced by the `useBoardCommitStatus` hook, especially if there are rapid state updates around the time of the transaction. The hook might be re-rendering with new (and incorrect) props/state before the query is made.

#### 3. Could React's polling interfere with Torii's indexing?

No, this is highly unlikely. Torii is a separate server process. Making read-only GraphQL queries to it, no matter how frequently, will not interfere with its indexing process, which reads from the Katana node.

#### 4. Could there be a transaction hash vs. transaction receipt timing issue?

This is a key difference between the two implementations, but it's more of a symptom than the root cause.

- **Vanilla JS:** `fire-and-forget` + `setTimeout(3000)`. This simple delay accidentally gives the node _and_ the indexer enough time to process everything.
- **React:** `waitForTransaction()` + immediate query. This creates a race condition where your first query runs _after_ the transaction is on-chain but likely _before_ Torii has indexed it.

However, this only explains why the _first_ query fails. It **does not explain why all subsequent queries in the `setInterval` also fail.** This is the critical clue that points away from timing and toward a persistent data error.

#### 5. Could the entity keys be case-sensitive or have invisible characters?

Absolutely. GraphQL string comparisons are exact. A difference in case (`0x...A` vs. `0x...a`) or an invisible character (like a newline or carriage return accidentally included in the template string) would cause the lookup to fail.

---

### Recommended Debugging Steps

Here is a clear path to isolate the root cause.

#### Step 1: Isolate the Data with Hardcoded Keys

This is the most crucial test. It will definitively tell you if the problem is with the _data_ being used in the query or the _way the query is being sent_.

1.  Run the **working Vanilla JS version** and successfully commit a board.
2.  From the browser console, copy the exact `currentGameId` and `account.address` string values.
3.  In your React hook (`useBoardCommitStatus.ts`), temporarily replace the variables with these hardcoded strings:

    ```typescript
    // In useBoardCommitStatus.ts

    // FOR DEBUGGING:
    const debugGameId = "0x...[PASTE_GAME_ID_FROM_VANILLA_JS]";
    const debugAccountAddr = "0x...[PASTE_ADDRESS_FROM_VANILLA_JS]";

    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8081/graphql", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: `{
          entities(keys: ["${debugGameId}", "${debugAccountAddr}"]) { // Use debug values
            // ... rest of query
          }
        }`,
      }),
    });
    ```

- **If this query succeeds:** The problem is 100% with the `gameId` or `account.address` variables in your React app's state. Proceed to Step 2.
- **If this query still fails:** The problem lies in how the React environment is making the `fetch` request (e.g., a misconfigured proxy, incorrect headers). This is less likely since you've checked the network tab, but this test would prove it.

#### Step 2: Verify Key Consistency at the Source

If Step 1 proves the data is the issue, you need to find the mismatch. Log the keys from both applications with more detail.

In **both** `game.js` (Vanilla) and `useGameContracts.ts` (React), add this log right before the `account.execute` call:

```javascript
console.log("TX SENDER ADDRESS");
console.log("Value:", account.address);
console.log("Type:", typeof account.address);
console.log("Length:", account.address.length);
```

Then, in `useBoardCommitStatus.ts` (React), add the same log before the `fetch` call.

Use a text comparison tool (like a diff checker) to compare the logged "TX SENDER ADDRESS" from the React contract hook with the address logged from the React query hook. Pay extremely close attention to padding, case, and length.

#### Step 3: Simplify the React Hook to Mimic Vanilla JS

To eliminate the polling and race condition as a complicating factor, temporarily simplify your `useEffect` hook to behave exactly like the vanilla version.

```typescript
// In useBoardCommitStatus.ts

useEffect(() => {
  if (!gameId || !account) {
    return;
  }

  // Mimic the simple delay from the vanilla JS implementation
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Running delayed check (4s)...");
    checkCommitStatus();
  }, 4000); // Give it an extra second to be safe

  return () => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
  };
}, [gameId, account]); // IMPORTANT: Remove `isCommitted` from deps for this test
```

If this simplified version works, it suggests a flaw in the more complex polling/re-rendering logic of the original hook. If it still fails, it reinforces that the underlying data is incorrect.

By following these steps, you can methodically narrow down the source of the discrepancy and resolve the issue. Good luck
